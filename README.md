# CS480FinalProject

The following code is expected to be run in the Kaggle environment, with train.csv and test.csv located at '/kaggle/input/uw-cs480-winter23/', and the noisy images at '/kaggle/input/uw-cs480-winter23/noisy-images/noisy-images'.

To run the code in the Kaggle environment, simply click "Run All". This will start the process of importing (and potentially downloading) all needed libraries/packages, data formatting/reading, the model initializations and training. During this process, there will be information produced in the logs for sample data as well as for the purpose of updating training progress. You can disregard these logs as they are solely informative.

At the end, the code will then produce a 'submissions.csv' file, which contains the predictions made for the items in 'test.csv' in the format {'id', 'category'}.
